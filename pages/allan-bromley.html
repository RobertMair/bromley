                <p><strong>Allan George Bromley</strong> (1 February 1947 - 16 August 2002) was an Australian historian
                    of computing who
                    became a world authority on many aspects of early computing and was one of the most avid collectors
                    of mechanical calculators.</p>
                <p>The work on understanding Charles Babbage's calculating engines is Allan Bromley's greatest legacy.
                    The October-December 2000 issue of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing was dedicated to him
                    for the quality of his research on this subject. His studies of the Antikythera mechanism, in
                    collaboration with Michael T. Wright, led to the first working model of this ancient analogue
                    computer.</p>
                <p>Bromley was an associate professor at the University of Sydney. His main academic interest was the
                    history of computers.</p>
                <p>He died of Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
                <h5>Biography</h5>
                <p>Bromley was born on 1 February 1947 and named after his uncle Allan, who was killed in New Guinea
                    during World War II, and his father George, who died on 8 August 1962. Bromley grew
                    up on a 30-acre (12 ha) property at Freeman's Reach, on the Hawkesbury River, in New South Wales,
                    Australia, in an historic home, "Sunny Corner". He completed his secondary education at Richmond
                    High School and in 1964, at the age of 17, his academic ability earned him a scholarship to study
                    science at the University of Sydney. He had been awarded the Nuclear Research
                    Foundation Medal, University of Sydney, Summer Science School, 1963.</p>
                <p>Bromley graduated in 1967, with first-class honours in physics, and stayed on for a research degree
                    in astrophysics He was awarded his PhD in 1971. His doctoral work on maser emission from
                    interstellar gas clouds required extensive computation with high-order polynomials, and awakened his
                    interest in computing.</p>
                <p>Bromley had an amateur interest in the history of mechanical inventions, and was aware of the
                    ancestral figure of Charles Babbage. No one had ever made a very detailed study of Babbage's papers
                    and, in a surprising career move, Bromley decided to turn historian, and took a year's sabbatical
                    leave in 1979 to work on the Babbage Papers at the Science Museum in London. What he found was
                    overwhelming: notebooks containing over 6,000 pages of Babbage's impenetrable scribblings, 300
                    machine drawings, and several hundred notations. They were to occupy Bromley for the next several
                    years. His first marriage, to Jann Makepeace, was during this time. Bromley convinced the Science
                    Museum in London that Babbage's Difference Engine No. 2, which had been designed between 1847 and
                    1849, could be built and, from 1989 to 1991, it was.</p>
                <p>After Babbage's engines, Bromley moved on to other historical computing artefacts. He made a
                    ground-breaking study of the Antikythera Mechanism, originally made famous by the Yale historian
                    Derek de Solla Price in the late 1950s. Price had speculated that the mechanism, dating from 50 BC,
                    was an astronomical calculating device. Bromley's background in astrophysics paid dividends, and
                    after several trips to Athens where he obtained radiographs of the inner mechanisms, and with the
                    help of a clockmaker Frank Percival, back in Sydney, they produced a working reconstruction. In
                    November 2000, Bromley was given a Distinguished Service Award and made an Honorary Associate of the
                    Powerhouse Museum, Sydney.</p>
                <p>In 1998, after a long spell of illness, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. He met Anne
                    Mitchell at that time and, on 15 April 2000 they married. He died on 16 August 2002.</p>
                <h5>Collections</h5>
                <p>Bromley started collecting mechanical calculators in 1979. A year later he already had sixty
                    pieces. Eventually he was responsible for a collection of old computers which used to be
                    displayed in the rear foyer of the building containing the University of Sydney Computer Science
                    Department. At home, he had a large personal collection of mechanical calculators, slide rules, and
                    the like. He was a generous donor of artefacts to museums in Australia, especially the Powerhouse
                    Museum in Sydney, and the Australian Computer Museum Society Inc.</p>
                <p>His collection included some rare pieces. The pride of place was taken by four mechanical
                    anti-aircraft gun predictors developed and built by the British government after World War I. The
                    machines, weighing about half a tonne, marked the height of mechanical computation; they were first
                    used in the Spanish Civil War and extensively during World War II. They performed in real-time and
                    were capable of predicting the firing angle to explode a shell within 10 metres of a plane at
                    anything up to 10,000 metres.</p>

                    we know about
                    Charles Babbage's Difference and Analytical engines really starts with the scholarship of Allan
                    Bromley.</p>
                <p class="indent">— Tim Berguin, Editor-in-chief, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Volume
                    22, number 4,
                    October-December 2000, p.2</p>
                <p>Part of Allan Bromley's scholarship was his study, at the Science Museum library in London, of the
                    original drawings for the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine designed by Charles Babbage more
                    than a century earlier. These studies and the most detailed analysis and interpretation led to the
                    reconstruction of two Difference Engines No. 2 under the direction of Doron Swade:</p>
                <p class="indent">During several visits to London beginning in 1979, Allan G. Bromley of the University
                    of Sydney in
                    Australia examined Babbage's drawings and notebooks in the Science Museum Library and became
                    convinced that Difference Engine No. 2 could be built and would work. I had independently read of
                    Babbage's hapless fate and become deeply puzzled as to why no one had tried to resolve the issue of
                    Babbage's failures by actually building his engine.</p>
                <p class="indent">In 1985, shortly after my appointment as curator of computing, Bromley appeared at the
                    science
                    museum carrying a two-page proposal to do just that. He suggested that the museum attempt to
                    complete the machine by 1991, the bicentenary of Babbage's birth. Bromley's proposal marked the
                    start of a six years project that became something of a personal crusade for me.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Bromley built a partial reconstruction of the Antikythera mechanism, one of the oldest (surviving)
                    geared mechanisms known. Working with Frank Percival, a Sydney clockmaker, he improved on an earlier
                    reconstruction by Derek J. de Solla Price. Having tested Price's theory using Meccano parts,
                    Bromley found that the mechanism was unworkable. Working with Percival, he improved the device by
                    altering the function of the handle so that one complete rotation would correspond to a single day,
                    which he considered to be the most obvious astronomical unit. Bromley worked with the same set of
                    parts as Price, but suspected that a gap in the mechanism was originally home to several extra
                    gears.</p>
                <p>Another breakthrough by Bromley concerned a train of gearing which appeared to have 15 and 63 teeth,
                    for which Price had been unable to discover a purpose. Price considered these numbers to be too
                    difficult to work with, and assumed that they should be corrected to 16 and 64, theorising that it
                    could have operated a four-year cycle on the device. Bromley worked with the original count of 15
                    and 63 teeth, discovering that the train's cycle was four and a half years; four of such cycles
                    equalled 18 years, a duration equal to the cycle of eclipses. With this gearing, the mechanism
                    worked correctly, with the pointer moving into a new square for each new moon, as the handle is
                    turned, meaning that each square on a dial represented one month. Over 223 months, or 18 years, the
                    complete cycle is shown.</p>
                <p>The model was acquired by the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences in early 2017.</p>
