                </div>
                <p>A <strong>slide calculator</strong>, also known as an <strong>Addiator</strong> after the best-known
                    brand, is a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, once made by Addiator
                    Gesellschaft of Berlin, Germany. Variants of it were manufactured from 1920 until 1982. The devices
                    were made obsolete by the electronic calculator.</p>
                <h5>Design</h5>
                <p>The Addiator is composed of sheet-metal sliders inside a metal envelope, manipulated by a stylus,
                    with an innovative carry mechanism, doing subtract ten, carry one with a simple stylus movement.
                    Some types of Addiators can also handle negative numbers (with a complementary bottom window or by
                    providing a subtraction mode on the back side of the device).</p>
                <p>The Addiator also handles non-decimal measurements, like feet and inches, or pre-decimalization
                    pounds, shillings, and pence. Addition and subtraction require different "screens", handled by
                    turning the instrument over, or flipping a front panel, or, later, by extended sliders and an extra
                    lower panel. Although not always advertised (e.g., the Magic Brain Calculator mentions "add,
                    subtract, multiply" on its front plate), procedures exist for multiplication (by repeated addition
                    or by individual digit multiplications) and division (e.g., by repeated subtraction, or use of
                    additions combined with complementary numbers).</p>
                <p>More expensive versions have a built-in slide rule on the back.</p>

                <h5>History</h5>
                <p>Sometime between 1666 and 1675, French polymath Claude Perrault invented the first slide calculator,
                    called Abaque rhabdologique (a rabdological abacus), when he needed to do a lot of calculations
                    while working as an architect.</p>
                <p>About three decades later, around 1700 or shortly after, French businessman and amateur mathematician
                    César Caze simplified Perrault's design and adapted it to counting money, getting a privilege
                    (patent) in 1711. However, neither of these devices implemented a carry mechanism.</p>
                <p>In 1845, German musician and amateur mechanic Heinrich Kummer, who was living in St. Petersburg, saw
                    a mechanical calculator of a different design made by Hayyim Selig Slonimski, and in the next year
                    borrowed the idea of its carry mechanism to greatly improve Caze's device, leading to the modern
                    variant of the slide calculator.</p>
                <h5>Addiator</h5>
                <p>In 1889, Louis-Joseph Troncet successfully commercialized the Addiator, which became one of the
                    most popular calculators of its kind, and the name is often used to refer to the type generally.
                    Addiators appeared in newspaper advertisements as early as 1921, listed at a price of £4 (equivalent
                    to £224.15 in 2023) in the Daily Record of Scotland. As of 1968, Addiators were advertised in
                    American newspapers starting at $3.98 each ($36.00 in 2024).</p>
